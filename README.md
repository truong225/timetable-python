## Timetable Language Document
This is my own timetable script that I have written in a while. It change Windows wallpaper when Windows startup acording the programming language I will learn in that day. The directory of wallpaper is static (`%dir% *.png`) and each picture is relevant to a specific language.

### Install
The script file `timetable.bat` put in the **Startup** directory of Windows. You can open this directory by **Run** command: `shell:startup`

### Modules
The script uses these following modules:
- `time`
- `ctypes`

### In the fure
This is just a simple script I write to learn Python (in this case is **`Python 2.7 32bit`**), so I want to innovate it soon, with some perfects features.
