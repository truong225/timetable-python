## Timetable Language Document
This is my own timetable script that I have written in a while. It change Windows wallpaper when Windows startup acording the programming language I will learn in that day. The directory of wallpaper is static (```%dir% *.png```) and each picture is relevant to a specific language.

### Install
The script file ```timetable_main.py``` put in the **Startup** directory of Windows
